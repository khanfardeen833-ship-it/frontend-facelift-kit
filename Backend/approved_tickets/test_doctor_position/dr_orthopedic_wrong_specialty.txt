NOTE: I am a highly skilled orthopedic surgeon but realize this position is for cardiology. 
I have NO cardiology training, no experience with echocardiography, no stress testing experience, 
and no cardiovascular disease management background. This is clearly not my specialty, but I 
wanted to submit my resume anyway. I do have EMR and HIPAA experience which are required!
